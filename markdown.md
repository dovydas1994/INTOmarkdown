## 1. Linux uppsetning
----------------------

I booted the Ubunut off the USB key. First, i downloaded Ubuntu 12.04 from the official Ubuntu webiste. Then i made the USB key bootable using the software called Unetbootin. After the software configured the USB key and made it bootable, i plugged in the USB key, changed the boot sequance in BIOS and as result the Ubuntu was up an running. I did however, faced some difficulties in accessing the BIOS, because i own an SSD hardrive and as result the bootup time of my computer is very fast. Therefore, i had very little time in pressing the F2 key - hence, i had to restart the computer several times in order to succesfully access bios. However, once i started the Ubuntu on my PC, everything was functioning very well - except i could not establish the internet connection, perhaps some newwork drivers were missing... So, i repeated the same process using my laptop, which is running windows 7. After, booting off the USB key, Ubuntu functioned perfectly in my laptop!     

Here is a screenshot of my machine booting up into linux:

## 2. Uppsetning á vim && git
-----------------------------

In this part i did not face any difficulties at all. I just typed in the commands provided and after few seconds evertying was ready.

## 3. Unnið með Git (1. hluti)
------------------------------

This part also went pretty well. At the beginning, it was relatively hard to work in the linux enviroment, because im so new to it - im very used to windows. Nonetheless, after some research on the common terminal commands, i started to feel pretty comfortable. Since, i was working alone in the group, i did not have any chance of sharing the code with other people. Here is the link to my forket repository: https://github.com/dovydas1994/OpenSourceHomework

## 4. Uppsettur hugbúnaður
--------------------------

Vim is a charityware. Its license is GPL-compatible, so it is an open software. Therefore, whenever the code is changed, all changes must be made public. Furthermore, it is possible to donate money and all of the donated money would be send to Uganda to help children there, through ICCF. Link where you can find the vim source code http://www.vim.org/sources.php. So by downloading the source code, you could change it and hence, help in further development of the sotware. 

Git is free software distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2 (hence it is free and open source). The source code of git could be found here: http://www.vim.org/sources.php. Since it is an open source, anyone can join in and help impriving it.

## 5. Unnið með Git (2. hluti)

Here i should fill in the results from part 4 again right? if my icelandic is not letting me down... :)
